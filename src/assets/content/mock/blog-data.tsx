        blogHeading: "Why Should You Hire Remote Developers?",
        content: "In the age of digitization, the need for software developers has increased substantially. Irrespective of the scale of their operations and the industries they hail from, businesses around the world are willing to hire skilled developers to improve their processes. However, when it comes to recruiting professionals, companies are often confused if they should hire remote developers or go with in-house office-going professionals. This decision depends on the specific needs and preferences of the organization making hires. However, looking at the rising trends of working remotely and setting up hybrid workplaces, it is safe to say that more and more organizations are leaning towards hiring remote developers. The need for remote developers and contractors has disrupted the manner in which employees are recruited and projects handled. This has also led to agencies and dedicated portals providing organizations with remote developers for hire. If you still have not made up your mind and are on the fence about selecting the right hiring approach, here are some of the most important reasons why you should hire remote developers. Saving Infrastructure Costs One of the biggest reasons why you should hire remote developers is that it helps you save your office expenses. Hiring office workers come with a range of overhead costs that need to be incurred for managing them. When you hire remote developers, all you need to pay them is their respective salaries. If you have hired a contractor, you wouldn’t even need to pay them on a regular basis. This helps you a fortune that could have been spent on office rent and a range of accessories. The money you save by hiring remote developers can be invested in more productive areas of your business. Increased Productivity Software development is an ideal combination of art and science. While it requires the application of specific methods, laws, and data, developers also need to be creative in developing platforms that stand out from the clutter. Although the pandemic has made companies follow a remote and flexible approach to work by default, IT companies have been providing this flexibility to workers for several years now. In most cases, developers are not required to come to the office every single day to do their work on-premise. As long as their tasks are completed and targets are achieved, it doesn’t matter where the developers are working from. This has made a lot of developers used to flexibility at work. Gone are the days when IT professionals would perform at the peak of their potential while doing a 9-to-5 job. Developers today can give their best when they are working from the comfort of their homes, cafes, or any location away from a conventional workplace. Also, being genius artists, some developers may be able to work best during odd hours. So, it is always advisable to hire remote developers if they feel genuinely driven to code from midnight to 3 AM in the morning! Wide Range Of Choices When you are willing to hire office workers, you do not have too wide a range of choices. If you need your employees to come to work every day, it only makes sense that you look for local candidates or the ones that can manage shifting base. On the other hand, when it comes to hiring remote developers, the sky is your limit! You can be sitting in New York and hire a developer from New Delhi if you think they are the best fit for the job. When you have a wide range of choices, you will not need to compromise any of your recruitment processes to get the best talent on board. No Compulsion For Employee Benefits When you hire office workers for software development, the company is obliged to provide them with a range of benefits, including social security, unemployment insurance, medical insurance, bonuses, and more. Especially if you run a new and growing company, this would add to your overall expenses incurred for managing your employees. In most cases, there is no compulsion for an organization to provide remote employees with the above-mentioned cases. The management often has a choice to offer these benefits to the employees and the extent of the same. Especially if you are remote developers on a contract basis, you will never have to provide them with specific employee benefits as you would after hiring in-house office workers. A Focused Approach To Work Software development is a job that required a good amount of focus and isolation. When you hire office workers, it is easy for them to get distracted by their peers, managers, team leaders, or anyone/anything within the office premises. They may also need to make commitments that aren’t always related to their work. On the other hand, remote developers can work with a much greater focus and commitment. As they do not need to work with their peers or managers being physically around them, they can concentrate better on the job at hand. However, this does not mean that working remotely is free from all distractions. Although there are distractions while developers work remotely, they can be tackled by sticking to strict deadlines that need to be met. Staying In Sync With Modern Technologies Lately, most technological advancements revolve around designing, developing, and operating on platforms and systems that facilitate remote working. The COVID crisis shot the adoption rates of collaborative platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and more. More and more organizations are moving from legacy systems to cloud-based platforms to scale their business processes. In the age of digitization, hiring remote developers would help you ride the digital bandwagon and stay in tune with the latest technologies prevalent in the industries. This allows your business to become future-proof and helps you prepare for unforeseen circumstances. Round-the-clock Availability One of the biggest reasons why you should hire remote developers is their round-the-clock availability. We live in an age where instant gratification is in demand. People want to get quick resolutions to their issues and obtain quick answers to their questions. Hiring office workers doesn’t always involve them providing round-the-clock services. It would only add to your office expenses. By hiring remote developers who can work night shifts for you, you can cater to your clients all day long without hampering the services provided to them. Especially if you hire IT contractors, you can certainly avail yourself of round-the-clock services. Better Employee Retention Rate We are currently witnessing an unfortunate phenomenon called The Great Resignation, especially in the west. Owing to altered work environments, burnouts, and hesitation to leave the new approach to work, more and more employees are leaving their current jobs and switching to better opportunities. A big reason behind this is the need to continue working in flexible work environments. When you hire remote developers and provide them with the much-needed work flexibility, they are likely to stay engaged with your organization for a longer period of time. The Final Word These were some of the most important reasons why you should hire remote developers over office workers. The new wave of emerging work trends demands a much-needed shift in the work culture adopted by an organization to stay relevant in the industry it operates in.",

        blogHeading: "Why Should You Hire Contractors Instead Of Full-time Employees?",
        content: "Employees are the building blocks for an organization and it is important for employers to focus on implementing the best approach for hiring new employees. Irrespective of the industry you operate in and the scale of your operations, there are two major ways in which you can hire new employees – hiring contract workers and hiring full-time employees. Hiring contractors involves availing of the services of employees only for a specific period of time. Here, the employees are hired on a contractual basis where the contract ends once the concerned task is completed. Such an approach is prevalent in the IT sector where companies require employees for specific projects. For example, if you are willing to hire Salesforce developers to set up a CRM platform, you can resort to hiring contractors that best fit the bill. On the other hand, hiring full-time employees involves recruiting employees on a full-time (salaried) basis. Here, the employees get associated with your organization for a longer period of time and represent the same in the industry. However, the practice of hiring full-time employees is fading away over time. Companies today prefer hiring contractors for specific projects over a pre-decided period of time. This has provided organizations with more control over their processes and the work to be done by the employees. Here are some of the major benefits of hiring contractors instead of full-time employees: Cost-effective Alternative One of the biggest benefits of hiring contract workers over full-time employees is the fact that it helps you save money. For example, if you are willing to implement Salesforce as your CRM platform, hiring full-time developers would require you to pay them a salary every week/month, whether you need their services or not. On the other hand, if you hire Salesforce programmers or developers on a contractual basis, you need to pay them only for the project they are supposed to work on. Here, you do not pay them for the services they do not offer. This prevents you from spending a fortune on a regular basis and saves more money that can be used in other productive areas of your business. Moreover, when your hire contractors, you are not required to pay perks and benefits the full-time employees are entitled to, such as workers’ compensation insurance, health insurance, unemployment insurance, tax social security, payroll taxes, and other expenses. All these savings help you add to your treasury that can be used elsewhere. Greater Flexibility As contractors are not permanent employees, hiring them provides you with increased flexibility. It does not require you to spend more time to onboard the employees and dealing with tedious paperwork. All you need to do is sign a contract and start the work on the decided date. Moreover, hiring contractors allows you to adapt to the changing workloads within your organization. While the in-house employees may not always be ready for additional workload without prior notice, you make necessary adjustments by hiring contractors at a short notice. Greater Expertise and Specialization When you hire contractors, you do so for getting specific tasks completed. This makes you look for employees who possess the required expertise and specialization. On the other hand, full-time employees may not always possess the required expertise for specific projects. Hiring employees on a contractual basis allows you to create a pool of talent with everyone possessing a dedicated skill. This helps you get your work done in a much more effective way as compared to delegating responsibility to in-house employees. For example, if you need to develop web applications with the help of Salesforce LWC (Lightning Web Components), it is always advisable to hire Salesforce developers trained in LWC instead of getting the in-house employees trained. This would ensure that the dedicated tasks are performed by employees that possess all the required skills to get the work done in the best way possible. Skipping Training And Development It is difficult for every in-house employee to possess every skill required to perform specific tasks. In such cases, it is always better to hire contractors instead of spending a fortune behind getting the in-house employees trained. The recruitment process of full-time employees often involves training and development. This requires the management to hire dedicated trainers and/or conduct workshops to get the employees trained. On the other hand, hiring contractors prevent you from organizing elaborate training sessions and hiring expensive trainers. Companies often prefer hiring employees who already possess the skills required to get the concerned job done. This allows them to get to work as soon as they come on board. Expanding Your Reach In most cases, organizations prefer hiring full-time employees that are geographically reachable. This makes keeping a track of their processes easier. On the other hand, no geographical boundaries matter when it comes to hiring contractors. A company located in the US can hire contractors working from India. This allows companies to expand their reach and build a team of skilled employees working from different corners of the world. Expanding your reach also allows you to diversify your team for a specific project. When you have the best workers from every domain working on a single project, it automatically increases the efficiency of work and helps you attain your objectives better. Greater Work Experience In the case of in-house employees, you may have to hire employees that would gain work experience after being associated with your organization for a few years. However, hiring contractors allows you to look for employees that already possess a sufficient amount of experience in the required field(s). When you have experienced workers on board, it leads to improved productivity and greater professionalism while working on dedicated projects. Things To Keep In Mind While Hiring Contractors Although hiring contractors has several benefits as opposed to hiring full-time employees, it is always advisable for organizations to do it the right way. Here are some of the most important things to keep in mind while hiring contract workers for your projects: Shortlist Ideal Employees Never go with the first employee that you come across, even if they possess all the required skills. When you are hiring contract workers, it is always advisable to assess several employees and create a shortlist of the most ideal candidates and hire employees out of the same. This would provide you with more options and help you make a comprehensive decision. Conduct A Thorough Background Check It is always advisable to conduct a thorough background check of the shortlisted contractors before you bring them on board. As these employees are not associated with the organizations for a longer period of time, companies often make the mistake of skipping this activity. Always make sure you are aware of their employment history, the skills they possess, their qualifications, and the reputation they hold in the industry. Make Them Well-versed With Your Organization Although contract workers will not be associated with your organization for too long, it is never advisable to alienate them from your workforce. Make sure that they are well-versed with the objectives you are willing to achieve, the role they are required to play, and the history of your organization. It is also advisable to communicate the work culture and policies of your organization before they start with their work. This allows the contract workers to feel comfortable while working for your organization and provides them with context for the tasks they are required to accomplish. Conduct Interviews Just like hiring in-house employees, hiring contract workers should involve conducting multiple rounds of interviews. This allows the management to assess the skills possessed by the candidates and make informed decisions about getting them on board. Moreover, make sure that the panel consists of industry experts who are aware of the nitty-gritty details of the concerned position in specific and the industry in general. Provide Suitable Incentives As the contract workers are not entitled to the perks and benefits provided to the full-time employees, they might start to slack after a point in time. To prevent his, it is advisable to provide the contractors with suitable employees for the work they do. This would provide them with a boost in their morale and motivate them to give their best. Motivated employees often lead to an increase in the overall rate of employee engagement and productivity within the organization. Recognize Their Efforts Never forget to recognize the efforts put in by the contractors when they help you with your projects. Acknowledging their contribution would make them feel like an integral part of your organization, motivating them to give their 100% in the work they do. This helps you build a cordial work environment and wholesome work culture. The Final Word These were some of the most important benefits of hiring contractors instead of full-time employees. Irrespective of the industry you operate in, it is always advisable to look for contract workers to work on your projects and add to the productivity of your organization.",

        blogHeading: "11 Disadvantages of Hiring Dedicated Developers",
        content: "Organizations across the world are often faced with the dilemma of choosing between hiring dedicated developers and outsourced developers. Over time, all major industries have shifted away from hiring dedicated developers. More and more organizations are now willing to hire contractors or outsourced developers for building web pages and applications. While hiring outsourced developers is not always the best option, here are some of the major disadvantages you should know if you are looking to hire dedicated developers: 1. Potential Lack Of Talent One of the biggest drawbacks of hiring dedicated talent is the fact that you may not always find the talent you are looking for. As your reach is fairly limited, you may have to compromise on your choices while hiring dedicated developers. For example, if you are willing to hire React developers who are well-versed in multiple technologies, developers in your city/region may not possess these qualifications. On the other hand, when it comes to hiring outsourced developers, the sky is the limit! You can look for the required talent across multiple platforms around the world. This offers you more chances to work with employees who are in sync with your specific requirements. 2. Limited Reach Choices When it comes to hiring dedicated employees, your sample size is often smaller as compared to hiring outsourced employees. When you are restricted in your choices, you may not end up hiring employees that meet all your requirements. In the case of hiring outsourced employees and contractors, you can reach out to developers working from the other corner of the world as your relationship ends when the decided project is completed. 3. Lesser Freedom For Dedicated Projects Dedicated employees are a part of your organization and need to make more commitments than the work they are hired to do. This may distract them from their core objectives, leading to reduced productivity. In the case of outsourced employees, they have more freedom to stick to the work they are assigned to do and leave once the project is finished. This provides the developers with a more focused perspective as compared to be being hired by an organization. 4. Higher Costs The hiring and management costs in the case of dedicated developers are always higher as compared to hiring contractors. Recruitment managers often need to allocate a good portion of the budget in posting ads, scheduling different rounds of interviews, and getting the employees onboard. In the case of contractors, all you need to do is pay for the work to be done by the developers. There is no need to pay for different perks that a company would otherwise pay for in the case of dedicated developers. 5. The Need For Training And Development As dedicated developers are often associated with an organization for a longer period of time, they need to be trained on a timely basis to keep them in sync with the technological trends. This often takes up a lot of the company’s time and money in hiring trainers, organizing workshops, and undertaking training sessions. In the case of hiring contractors, there is hardly the need to train them. All you need to do is ensure that the developers are already trained in the skills and technologies you need to hire them for. Once they are on board, they need not be taught any more skills, making them perform their tasks with efficiency. 6. Delay In Starting With Work Dedicated employees hardly get to the projects immediately after getting onboarded. They often require to be given time and space to adjust to the new work environment and the peers they work with. This is likely to result in unwanted delays, resulting in a dip in the company’s productivity. On the other hand, contractors immediately get to work once hired. This helps you streamline your processes without waiting for the employees to get comfortable with the work environment. As contractors need not work for the company full-time, they can start and finish their work on time. Moreover, contractors often provide round-the-clock services once they start with the work. While dedicated employees often end their work once their work hours are completed, you can avail of flexible work hours in the case of outsourced employees. 7. Lack Of Diversity In the case of dedicated employees, there is rarely diversity in the team. The team is likely to possess developers possessing more or less the same skills. In order for an organization to scale up its services, it is important to have a diverse team of employees. On the other hand, hiring contractors allows you to get diverse employees in your team. As you can reach out to potential developers from anywhere across the world, it helps you add members to the team with different skills. This helps you get your work done on time and with greater precision. 8. Limited Perspective As hiring dedicated employees leads to a lack of diversity in your teams, it provides you with a limited perspective when it comes to making important decisions. This often limits the creative and analytical skills needed to make decisions that matter. When you build a team of diverse employees by hiring contractors, you can have a better perspective on different matters of your organization. Here, group meetings are more open-minded, free-flowing, and productive as everyone has a unique opinion on different matters. This allows the management to make quick and informed decisions in the interest of the organization. 9. Longer Onboarding Process The process of onboarding dedicated developers is considerably longer as compared to getting contractors on board. Right from providing them with the required resources to conducting an orientation, it takes longer for an organization to bring new dedicated employees on board. While onboarding in the case of contractors is not non-existing, the process is much shorter as compared to hiring dedicated employees. Here, the HR department need not spend much time and effort in getting new developers on board. 10. Lower Relevance To Modern Technology As dedicated employees work in an organization for a longer period of time, the developers tend to stick with traditional technologies for way too long. This reduces the relevance of the company to the modern technology and tools that are relevant at any point in time. On the other hand, you can look for contractors that are already equipped with the latest technologies. This helps you stay in sync with the trends and advancements that are prevalent in the industry. When your relevance to technology trends is higher, you can provide better services to your customers and build healthier relations with them. 11. Conflicts And Arguments When employees are associated with an organization for too long, conflicts and misunderstandings are bound to happen. Hard feelings within teams affect the engagement and productivity of the employees. No such issues will arise in the case of hiring contractors. As they are not associated with your company beyond the projects they are assigned, there are lesser chances of tussles between them and their peers. This leads to a cordial work environment and a conducive work culture. When Should You Hire Dedicated Developers? Now that we are well-versed with the disadvantages of hiring dedicated developers, it is important to understand the scenarios that are ideal for bringing them on board. Here are a few circumstances that call for hiring dedicated developers: When The Scope Of Your Project Is Not Clear Whenever the scope of a development project is unclear, the development process takes a fairly long time. In the case of longer projects, it is advisable to hire dedicated developers who can provide you with their time and consistency. When You Need The Work To Be On-premise As dedicated developers are often hired locally, it is advisable to hire them when you are willing the work to be on-premise. In such cases, you can have an entire team working from a simple office where their activities can be monitored live and in real-time. This also provides increases work flexibility as decisions can be made on the spot. When You Have Locally Available Talent When you are able to find developers with the required skills locally, you can go ahead with hiring dedicated employees. This allows you to build a long-term relationship with your employees possessing the skills you are looking for. When You Need To Build A Large Team If you are willing to build a large team of developers for a project, it is advisable to hire dedicated developers. This provides you with homogeneity within your organization, making it easier to manage different processes across the board. The Final Word These were some of the major disadvantages of hiring dedicated developers and the circumstances that call for hiring them. Although companies prefer hiring contractors as compared to dedicated employees, it is important to make necessary assessments before you make your decision. Make you are thorough with the requirements of your projects in specific and organization in general before you make new hires.",

        blogHeading: "9 Best Benefits Of Hiring Contractors",
        content: "Over time, hiring trends across the board have gone through substantial changes. Employers are no longer willing to hire in-house employees for their companies. Instead, they prefer to hire contractors to whom the concerned job is offered. Hiring contractors have resulted in a shift in recruitment norms and practices in all major industries. Especially in the IT sector, processes like IT staff augmentation have become simpler and more effective with the trend of hiring contractors. As the name suggests, contractors are employees who are hired on a contractual basis. These workers are employed for a specific duration of time in order to perform a specific set of processes. They are not associated with an organization for a longer period of time and end the association once the task is completed. Organizations often prefer hiring contractors from overseas to increase their reach and flexibility. This allows organizations to reach out to employees from any corner of the world to perform the required tasks. Contractors have become common in major industries like sales and marketing, finance, Information Technology, and many more. This has provided organizations to go global in terms of making hires and increase flexibility in the recruitment processes. Here are some of the major benefits of hiring contractors: 1. No Need For Training And Development Organizations often spend a fortune for training and development purposes in the case of hiring in-house employees. Especially when new employees are hired, the management recruits dedicated trainers, organizes workshops, and sets up seminars to get their employees trained. In the case of hiring contractors, there is no need for training and development. Here, organizations tend to look for employees that are already trained in the required skills and capabilities. This prevents the need for training them once they are on board. All you need to do is make new hires with the employees getting to work right away. This helps you save a fortune that would have spent in getting the employees trained. 2. Spending Lesser Money Behind Employees Managing in-house employees often requires the management to spend a considerable amount of funds in the form of regular salaries. Apart from salaries, companies tend to spend money in the form of perks like employee benefit schemes, health insurance, etc. On the other hand, hiring contractors allows you to save money that can be used for other productive purposes. Instead of paying salaries on a regular basis, you simply need to pay the decided sum for the work done by the employees. 3. More Focus On Projects As in-house employees are a part of an organization for a longer period of time, they need to commit to a range of activities apart from the work they are hired to do. This is likely to divert their focus, affecting their overall productivity. In-house employees are often required to take part in events and activities organized by the management, sacrificing their work hours. In the case of hiring contractors, the employees are allowed to focus more on their projects. This is because they are not really a permanent part of the organizations they work in. This also provides them a free hand in the work they do without many interruptions arising out of their commitments towards the company. When your employees can focus more on the projects they are hired for, it increases their engagement and productivity, helping you attain your goals and objectives in the best way possible. 4. Staying In Sync With The Market Trends In the age of digitization, it is important for organizations to be in sync with the current trends of the market. This allows them to have an edge over their competitors and carve a niche for themselves. When you hire in-house workers, they need to upgrade their skills and capabilities as they are associated with the companies for a longer period of time. As mentioned earlier, this leads to the management training the employees in order to keep them in sync with the trends. On the other hand, hiring contractors allows you to be market-relevant without spending time and money behind training your employees. When organizations look for contractors, they always look for employees that already possess skills that are relevant in the market at that point in time. Also, as they are not supposed to be associated with your company for too long, you need not bother about keeping their skills upgraded. 5. Getting A Wider Reach With in-house employees, your choices are often limited as you may be required to stick to hiring employees within your vicinity. This may require you to make compromises if you are not able to find employees that possess all the required skills. On the other hand, there are no such restrictions when it comes to hiring contractors. You can choose to hire employees working from any region, state, or country as per your needs. This provides you with a much wider reach as compared to hiring in-house employees. IT companies often resort to hiring developers on a contractual basis from multiple countries. Getting contractors on board allows you to build a global team of employees that provide you with the respective expertise and possess the skills you are looking for. 6. Building A Team Of Diverse Professionals In 2021, organizations cannot afford to hire a team of professionals with the same skills and perspectives. This is likely to stagnate their growth and limit their horizons. In the case of hiring in-house employees, there is a possibility of building a team that lacks diversity. Here, the decisions made during meetings are often generic instead of rich with multiple perspectives. On the other hand, one of the biggest benefits of hiring contractors lies in the fact that you get to form a team of diverse professionals. As there are no geographical boundaries when it comes to hiring contract workers, you have a team where every member has a unique perspective and point of view. This makes your team meetings more insightful, progressive, and rich in ideas. 7. Greater Work Flexibility Working with contractors offers a higher degree of flexibility as compared to working with in-house employees. The in-house employees are bound by the rules, policies, and boundaries of the organizations they work in. Also, organizations have greater freedom to hire contractors as and when they need them. They need not stay associated with the company once the concerned work is job is completed. If your organization has a short-term requirement for an employee, it is never advisable to go with hiring full-time workers. Getting contractors on board allows you to avail of their services until the concerned project needs to be completed at a pre-decided time. 8. Going Beyond The 9-5 Approach To Work In most cases, in-house employees are still required to work for a dedicated number of hours, whether they are working remotely or on-premise. Millennials and the Gen-Z employees are willing to break away from this routine while ensuring that the work does not suffer. Hiring contractors allows you to adopt the modern work culture that does not confine employees to the 9-5 approach. Contractors often provide their services with a flexible schedule, provided the project they are working on does not suffer. This makes for a win-win situation for the employers as well as employees. While the employees get to work without dedicated work hours, the employees get their work done over a specified period of time at lower costs. 9. Testing Suitable Employees For Full-time Opportunities Interestingly, contractors often provide companies with opportunities to see if they can be provided with full-time job opportunities. Companies around the world end up hiring contractors who are full-time workers if the management is impressed by their performance. Important Considerations For Hiring Contractors The gig economy has prompted companies across all major industries to hire contractors instead of in-house employees. It is important to keep the hiring process precise and effective to ensure that you have the right employees on board. Here are some of the most important considerations to keep in mind as you hire contract workers: Make Use Of Multiple Sources It is never advisable for employers to stick to a single source for hiring contractors. Right from social media platforms to job portals, make sure you look for suitable contractors across the board. Never Settle With The First Application Especially if there is an urgent requirement of a contract worker, companies often go ahead with hiring the first feasible resume that comes across the recruitment managers. This should be avoided and multiple options should be looked at before hiring a suitable contractor. Conduct Multiple Interviews It is always advisable to pass your candidates through at least two rounds of interviews – the HR interview and the technical interview. Especially in the case of IT companies, it is important for employees to make sure that the hired contractors possess all the required skills and capabilities. The Final Word In the age of digitization where the gig economy is thriving, these are the benefits that should encourage you to hire contractors instead of getting full-time employees on board.",

        blogHeading: "Direct Hire Vs Contract Employees: Which One Is Better For Your Company?",
        content: "Employees are the building blocks of an organization. Their skills, efforts, and dedication allow your organization to attain its objectives and carve its niche in the industry. This makes it important for organizations to choose the most suitable mode of hiring their employees. When it comes to hiring employees, there are two major ways in which you can go about it – direct hires and hiring contract employees. While direct hire involves recruiting full-time in-house employees, contract employees are hired for a specific period of time and for performing specific jobs. Companies are often confused about choosing an ideal mode of hiring employees. In order to make the right decision, it is important to compare the pros and cons of both direct hire and hiring contract employees. In essence, there is no correct way of hiring employees. It depends on your needs, preferences, and the positions for which you are making hires. Benefits Of Making Direct Hires Getting Full-time Representatives On Board When you make a direct hire, you get full-time representatives of your organization on board. These employees are often associated with your organization for a longer period of time and provide you with consistent services. This helps you in spreading awareness about your brand as these employees carry the same wherever they go. In essence, these employees become an integral part of your organization. Scope For Promotions Direct hires provide you with a scope of promoting your employees over a period of time. This allows you to avail yourself of improved services of your employees as they climb the ladder. Moreover, this motivates your employees to work harder and boosts their morale, leading to an increase in employee engagement. Ultimately, higher engagement leads to increased organizational productivity. Building Long-term Relations As the direct hires are associated with your employees for a longer period of time, it allows you to form lasting relationships with them. This helps you strengthen the bond between the management and the employees. Ability To Retain Talent As opposed to hiring contract employees, you can retain your valuable in-house employees. If you are happy with the value added by the employees to your organization, you can provide them with incentives and ask them to be associated with your company for a longer period of time. Drawbacks Of Making Direct Hires Lack Of Flexibility Making direct hires limits the work flexibility within your organization. Here, the employees are dedicated to performing specific tasks during dedicated work hours. If you are willing to avail yourselves of their services beyond work hours, it is difficult to do so. For example, if an IT company is gets a new Java development project, it may not be able to allocate the available resources for the same. The company would rather hire Java developers on a contract basis. Spending More Money Direct hires often drain a lot of funds out of the treasury of your organization. They need to be paid their salaries on a regular basis, even for the days when you did not require their services. Moreover, every full-time employee is entitled to benefits and perks to be provided by the management, further adding to your expenses. Lack Of Focus As direct hires are associated with your organization, they are required to take an active part in events and give commitments apart from the jobs they were hired to do. This pulls them out of their core competency and takes up their time that could have been used in a constructive manner. Longer Hiring Process Making direct hires requires the management to undertake a hiring process that is fairly long and tedious. Recruitment managers are required to put up ads inviting applicants, create a pool of ideal candidates, and select the best ones to work on a full-time basis. This often takes up a lot of time and resources for your organization. Delay In Getting Started Once the direct hires are brought on board, they do not start with their work on an immediate basis. They need to be onboarded properly – a process that involves providing them with the required resources, making them comfortable with the new team members, and ensuring that they gel well within the new work environment. This may lead to the organization losing much of its valuable time that can be utilized in a productive manner. Need To Train The Employees In the case of direct hires, employees are often required to be trained in specific skills in order to stay in sync with the market requirements. This further leads to the organization having to spend a considerable amount of time and money in hiring training and organizing extensive training sessions until the employees are thoroughly trained. Benefits Of Hiring Contract Employees Cost-effective Mode Hiring contract workers allows you to save a good amount of money as there is no need to pay regular salaries to them. You just need to pay them for the work they do and for the period of time they do it for. Moreover, you need not pay contract workers for the benefits your direct hires are entitled to. This helps you save a good amount of funds that can be allotted to many productive activities. Greater Flexibility Contract workers are available on an on-demand basis, making the hiring process flexible. Whenever you are in need of employees for new and/or additional projects, you can hire them for a specific period of time. Moreover, most contract workers do not stick to dedicated work hours. You can avail yourself of their services with a flexible schedule based on your needs and preferences. Avoiding Employee Training As opposed to direct hires, there is no need to train contract workers once they are on board. They are already trained in the skills required to perform the concerned tasks. This saves your organization time and money spent on hiring trainers and organizing training sessions. No Delay In Starting Work When you hire contract workers, you need not wait for them to start with their work. Unlike direct hires, there are no extensive onboarding processes that take up their time. As soon as they are hired, you can assign them the projects and ask them to get started on the same. Quick Hires In the case of hiring contract employees, your recruitment managers do not need to spend their time creating a pool of talent and selecting the ideal full-time employees. Here, you can post your job requirements on an ideal platform, receive applications, and get the employees on board without any unnecessary delays. This makes hiring contract workers an ideal option if you are looking for employees on an immediate basis. Greater Focus On Work As opposed to direct hires, contract workers can work with greater focus. This is because they do not have commitments towards any event or activity apart from the job they are required to do. This allows them to complete the work faster and make all deliveries on time. Drawbacks Of Hiring Contract Employees Inability To Retain Talent A major drawback of hiring contract employees is the fact that it is difficult to retain talent. If you find the services provided by an employee extraordinary, you cannot retain them by offering them perks and incentives. While you can offer them full-time job opportunities, you can never be sure if they would accept the same. This may lead to the company losing an important asset in the long run. Lack Of Long-term Relationships The long-term bond developed between the management and direct hires is rarely reflected in the case of hiring contract employees. As these employees are associated with your organization for a limited period of time and they are completely dedicated to their work, there is little scope in establishing a long-term relationship with them. Inability To Integrate With The Company Culture It takes a good amount of time for an employee to get the essence of the company culture and become a part of the same. In the case of contract employees, this is not possible as they are not associated with an organization for a longer period of time. They are, therefore, not possible to be fully integrated with the culture of the company they work with. Lack Of Promotions If you are hiring contract employees, you would not be able to promote them. Their role and their association with your organization end once their work is done. This prevents the company from promoting them to higher positions and providing them with seniority. If you are willing to do so, you would have to offer them full-time jobs. Not A Complete Representation Of Your Organization While your in-house employees can claim to represent your company at all times, contract employees cannot do so. Although they become a part of your organization for a limited period of time, they cannot be labeled as your employees for too long. The Final Word Depending on the kind of employees you are looking for, the money you are willing to spend, and the kind of vacancies you are looking forward to filling, you can choose to go with either making direct hires or hiring contract employees. The pros and cons mentioned above would help you make your choice easier.",

        content: "As a business owner, your employees are your biggest asset. Employees are the one who performs your day to operations and represents your company and informs your clients. Hence order to remain profitable, it’s very important to know the challenges that an employee faces in an organization so that your business can always thrive. What’s the issue? Reports in 2023 suggested that there are several challenges in attracting and retaining employees. While some employers have a voice out saying that they have trouble retaining their employees.  This happens because there are a lot of companies that are constantly hiring but not providing the right salary, or employees are shifting to companies that are providing double the salary that they are currently working on.  So if the rate of hiring is increasing the rate of quitting is also increasing. We have to realize that this is the age of the millennial.  So attracting and retaining talented employees is the need of the hour. They are not following the traditional route of sticking to one company till retirement. They act as free agents who are willing to do employer-to-employer shifts if they see a better opportunity for themselves. Work is no longer sitting in a cubicle and coming home Earlier people used to start their work journey at 9 am. Sit in a cubicle, do their work, and come home. They had fixed incomes and we're committed to one job. Nowadays things have changed, people prefer working from home and doing side hustles to have more income. That’s why this era has seen the rise of independent contractors or freelancers Covid acted as a game changer When we are into the initial days of COVID, thousands of employees were sent home. Once they become comfortable in the home and enjoyed the extra time with family and friends, calling them back to the office were hard and challenging.  Employees did not have to commute to work, enjoyed their space at home, and achieved satisfaction working this lifestyle.  Covid created a shift in mindset. Why retention plan is the need of the hour? Creating an employee retention plan will provide you with skilled workers who would go the extra mile for your business. Thus creating a good work-life balance would be your biggest selling point. Your retention plan should include work-from-home opportunities with flexible timelines. Once you create a perfect work environment then things will automatically fall into place Various studies have suggested that employees don’t just leave a company if the salary is less; they leave if there is no opportunity grows. Thus your employee attraction and retention strategy should always involve training programs and opportunities that would let them move ahead in the company hierarchy Just giving them recognition as the employer of the month is not enough now. As an employer, you should always acknowledge the employee and their hard work. Say for example if an employee did excellent work on the project, make sure that you push a message saying “thank you for your hard work, appreciate the contribution to our company” Okay, salary is not the final call, but it surely helps the employees to take your business seriously.  When you offer good wages to your employees, they work hard knowing that their work is getting the value it deserves.  By increasing wages, you set your business for success.
